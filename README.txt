The Kernl WP Site Performance Monitor periodically checks your site performance and allows you to track your response time, time to first byte (TTFB), and Lighthouse scores all from your WordPress admin.

== Description ==

The [Kernl](https://kernl.us) WP Site Performance Monitor tracks your WordPress site performance all from the comfort of your own WordPress Admin. Easily keep track of:

- Response time - We will check your site's response time every 10 minutes and graph it out over the past 24 hours.
- Time to first byte (TTFB) - In addition to response time, we track TTFB so you know how quickly your site responds initially to requests.
- Lighthouse Scores - The same tool that powers [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) is automatically run against your site once a day.
